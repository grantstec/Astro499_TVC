Commit rules:

  Each commit message should describe what the change does. Follow a standard format like:
	
	1.feat: description for new features.
	
  	2.fix: description for bug fixes.
	 
  	3.refactor: description for code improvements that do not change functionality.
	 
  	4.docs: description for documentation updates.
	 
  	5.test: description for adding or updating tests.
	 
  	6.chore: description for small maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies).
  
  Integration Rules:
	
	  1. Use branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments (e.g., feature/branch-name or bugfix/branch-name).
	 
	  2. Ensure all new code is committed to the relevant branch and avoid direct commits to the main or master branch without reviews.
	 
	  3. Before merging code into the main branch, ensure it has been reviewed by at least one other team member.
	 
	  4. Use pull requests (PRs) for merging, and provide a clear description of the changes in the PR.

  Commit Message Rules:
	
  	1. Keep the first line of a commit message under 50 characters.
	 
  	2. Provide additional details in the following lines if necessary, but make the summary clear and concise.
    
  Other Notes:
	
	small, frequent commits rather than large, monolithic commits. This helps with tracking changes and isolating issues.
 
  	Each commit should focus on a single task or change. Avoid combining unrelated changes in one commit.
  
  Why?: 
	
	This is very important as it can be used for documentation of progress and other things useful later on
